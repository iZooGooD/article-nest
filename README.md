## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend**:  
The frontend is built using modern tools to ensure a responsive and scalable user experience:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): The core library for building the user interface.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): For a strongly typed, maintainable codebase.
- [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod): For schema validation and type-safe data handling.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for fast and easy styling.

**Backend**:  
The backend will be developed using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.

## üí° Vision
